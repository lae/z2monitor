# zabbixmonitor

A command line interface for viewing alerts from a Zabbix instance.

This is a quick mashup to get on the ground running, but I plan on doing quite
a bit more work than what's probably currently here.

## Setting Up

Edit profiles.yml with your correct login credentials (copy from profiles.yml.example).

In the directory you have your profiles.yml located in, run zabbixmon.rb:

    cd zabbixmonitor
    ./lib/zabbixmon.rb
