# zabbixmonitor

A command line interface for viewing alerts from a Zabbix instance.

This is a quick mashup to get on the ground running, but I plan on doing quite
a bit more work than what's probably currently here.


## Setting Up

Edit profiles.yml with your correct login credentials (copy from profiles.yml.example).

Probably not working right now.

cd zabbixmonitor/lib

Run "./watchmon.rb"
